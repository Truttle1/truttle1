![Hi! I'm Truttle1](img.png)

Welcome to my GitHub page!

If you know me from anything, it's probably from my [YouTube Videos](https://youtube.com/c/Truttle1) about various esoteric programming languages (also known as esolangs).

Some other projects I'm working on are:

- Miniboss Game (working title), a turn based RPG in Unity.
- ToyBox (again a working title), a small Lua-based game engine written in TypeScript, with a web based editor and browser.
